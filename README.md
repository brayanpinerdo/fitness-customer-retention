## 🎯 Objective
Build a predictive model to identify users at risk of churn in a fitness app, enabling data-driven retention strategies.

---

## 📊 Dataset
| Detail | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Source** | TripleTen (simulated fitness activity data) |
| **Records** | ~10,000 users |
| **Description** | Includes demographics, activity levels, app interactions, and subscription status. |

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Preprocessed user data (encoding, missing values, feature engineering)  
2. Conducted EDA to find churn patterns  
3. Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
4. Evaluated performance by accuracy and recall  
5. Interpreted feature importance for retention strategies

---

## 💡 Key Insights
- Random Forest achieved 86% churn prediction accuracy.  
- Workout frequency and session duration were key predictors.  
- Users inactive for 10+ days had 70% higher churn risk.  
- Insights supported a targeted re-engagement campaign.
